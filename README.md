# A Demo Web application with the CodeIgniter 4

This is a concise but enterprise-level web application demo that is quite similar to the project I have done for the ZiHan Art Studio Portal & Management system.
The Demo's core features include:
* Signup: User account registration with the official Shield package
* Authentication: login with remember me
* User administration
* Role-based access control
* Account activation by email
* File uploads and image processing
* Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) for database records
* The whole codebase focuses on decoupling and maintainability between modules
